# Alpha Improvement Proposals (AIPs)
Alpha Improvement Proposals (AIPs) describe standards for Alpha Finance Lab platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

# Contributing
1. Review AIP-1.
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your AIP to your fork of the repository. There is a template AIP here.
4. Submit a Pull Request to Alpha Finance Lab's AIPs repository.

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final AIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new AIP and assign it a number before merging it.

If your AIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that AIP as follow: assets/aip-X (for aip X). When linking to an image in the AIP, use relative links such as ../assets/aip-X/image.png.

When you believe your AIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase, you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the AIP editors will update the state of your AIP to 'Approved'.
